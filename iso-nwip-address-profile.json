For example, most French postcodes commence with the 2-digit number of the Département; British ones are separated into two parts, with the first being a two, three or four character code which indicates the postal district and the second identifying a delivery address or set of addresses within this.",

It may, however, relate to other grouping parameters, such as special services.",

In such a case, the defining authority for the delivery point specification will normally be the identity of the postal operator which owns or serves the delivery point concerned. Even where this is not the case, different operators might have different ways of specifying a particular delivery point. For example, in the U.K., Hays has its own system of “DX codes” which differ from the postcodes in use by The Post Office."
