Interchange address class corresponds to the `addressClass` specified in
<<ISO19160-1>>.

A single profile can include and support multiple types of
address formats, such as a numbered street address and a
"PO Box" address simultaneously. Each of these address formats
is represented as an interchange address class.

[example]
The US Numbered Thoroughfare Address with this syntax can be
represented as an interchange address class:
"`{ Complete Landmark Name or Complete Place Name }
+ { Complete Address Number * }
+ { Complete Street Name * }
+ { Complete Subaddress }
+ { Complete Place Name * }
+ { State Name * }
+ { Zip Code }
+ { Zip Plus 4 }
+ { Country Name }`"

An interchange address class also provides a display template
and a form template to allow the display and entry of an
address instance of the address class.
