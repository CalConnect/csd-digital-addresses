=== Address Specification Level

When an address is first manually entered by a common person, it is
unrealistic to expect this person to fully adhere to the defined
structure.

There are three states of a structured address after being input:

* Unstructured. The user has entered free-form text with no regard of
structuring them.

* Partially structured. Country, city and postcodes may be listed
correctly, but the other components may be listed in the same row due
to previous habits.

* Fully structured. All components are accurately separated and cannot
be further split.

Therefore, an organization who accepts these addresses may wish to
re-structure them or fill in any missing address components.

The status of the address can be specified within an address instance
through the Address Capabilities structure, with the performer
optionally providing a signature.
