by just one display template.

[[display-line]]
=== Display line

A display line represents a line within a display layout.

It extends from the `LineElementReference` model, and
takes a set of elements that contain
display line element references (`DisplayLineElementReference`).

[[display-line-element-ref]]
=== Display line element reference

[[display-line-element]]
=== Display line element

This represents an element within a display line.

The two types of display line elements include:

* display line text element, representing static text, such as the
phrase "PO Box" preceding the actual PO box number,
for display layouts for PO boxes.

* display line data element, representing a variable data value
that is contained in the interchange address component, such
as the PO box number following the phrase "PO Box".
