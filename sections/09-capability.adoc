Address capability represents the status of a particular aspect of an
interchange address instance, as determined by an address processor.
Each of the aspects may be differentiated by multiple statuses.

This is an abstract class.
To represent specific capabilities, this class should be extended upon.

=== Capabilities

==== Quality

An address entered may not have been validated for correctness.
An address processor, such as a postal handling entity,
may decide to validate the address to a certain degree
in order to determine the correctness of the address.

The allowed values of validation statuses are:

* Confirmed correct, indicating that the address is confirmed
  to be correct to the best of knowledge of the address
  processor.

* Possibly correct, indicating with confidence that the address
  is correct.

* Structurally correct, indicating that the address components
  have the correct value types.

* Unknown, indicating that this address has not been validated
  in any way, and it cannot be assigned a quality.


==== Specification level

When an address is first manually entered by a common person, it is
unrealistic to expect this person to fully adhere to the defined
structure.

The allowed values of specification levels are:

* Fully structured, all components are accurately separated and cannot
be further split.

* Partially structured, some components may be structurally
correct, but some other components are still unstructured.

* Unstructured, the user has entered free-form text with no regard of
structuring them.

[example]
Digital addresses entered on e-commerce sites and address books
are often partially structured, with defined country, region
and city, but with street addresses often unstructured.

[example]
Digital addresses for utility installations
(e.g. electricity, water supplies) are often fully structured.

Therefore, an organization who accepts these addresses may wish to
re-structure them or fill in any missing address components.
