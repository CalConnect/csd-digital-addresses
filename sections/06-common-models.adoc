I think here it could be very useful to distinguish elements from
19160-1 from elements added by 19160-6

Elements used from other documents such as 19160-1 are
all explicitly identified.

=== Signature

A cryptographic signature used to determine data integrity and
validity of the object it belongs to.

|===
|Attribute |Type              |Description
|algorithm |`PT_Locale`       |The public key cryptographic algorithm used for
this digital signature.
|publicKey |`Uri`             |A reference to the actual public key used to
verify the digital signature, a URI where the public key of the signer used for
this signature is found.
|signature |`CharacterString` |The actual digital signature value encoded in Base64 format.
|===

NOTE: Public key information should be verified on a separate
communication channel from the signed object itself to ensure the
integrity and validity of the public key.

=== Localization

The language and script used within this interchange address profile.

Represented by the `PT_Locale` object defined in <<ISO19115-1>> and an
<<ISO15924>> script code.

|===
|Attribute |Type                                |Description
|locale    |<<ISO19115-1>> `PT_Locale`          |The locale of the parent
object.
|script    |<<ISO15924>> Script Identifier Code |The type of written
script used in the parent object.

Does it use PT_Locale ?
****

[source=Ronald Tse]
****
We didn't intend to use PT_Locale but perhaps it could work better here:

a) PT_Locale refers to ISO 3166-1, which contains three sets of codes:
alpha-2, alpha-3 and numeric. For clarity purposes in implementation,
could we lock it down to one set of these codes?
****

[source=Stephane Garcia]
****
Yes it would be a valid extension of ISO 19115
****

****
b) MD_CharacterSetCode refers to an IANA character set registry which describes the "encoding" but not the "script" used. For example, Chinese can be represented in Traditional or Simplified script -- in the IANA character registry, the encoding for both are usually Unicode and represented as UTF-8. Perhaps we could represent the ISO 15924 "script code" in an adjacent attribute?
****

[source=Stephane Garcia]
****
I don't think adding an attribute to PT_Locale would be a valid extension of ISO 19115.

I suggest leaving localization (or locale) with an attribute of type PT_Locale for the language / country code / encoding + leaving the attribute script.
And also we should ask for a change in ISO 19115-1 to add “script” into PT_Locale if we think it is needed.

=== Validity

****
version: Is it taken from MD_Identifier ?
****

[source=Ronald Tse]
****
version:
It was meant to be a simplistic “version” that allows differentiation of different instances of the published data. Would usage of MD_Identifier here be an overkill, since it includes many other attributes like authority, code, codeSpace, and description? Or we could find a way to align with it?
****

The time interval where this interchange address profile
is determined valid, and the revision number (represented as a date).

|===
|Attribute      |Type                     |Description
|validityBegins |<<ISO19115-1>> `CI_Date` |The date and time when this object becomes valid.
|validityEnds   |<<ISO19115-1>> `CI_Date` |The date and time when this object becomes invalid.
|revision       |<<ISO19115-1>> `CI_Date` |Issuance date/time of this object.
