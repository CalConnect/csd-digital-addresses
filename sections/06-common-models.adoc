I think here it could be very useful to distinguish elements from
19160-1 from elements added by 19160-6

Elements used from other documents such as 19160-1 are
all explicitly identified.

=== Signature

A cryptographic signature used to determine data integrity and
validity of the object it belongs to.

algorithm:: the public key cryptographic algorithm used for this
digital signature, represented by the algorithm's object identifier (OID)
defined in <<ISO14888-3>>.

publicKey:: a reference to the actual public key used to verify
the digital signature, a URI where the public key of the signer
used for this signature is found. Represented as a `Uri`.

NOTE: Public key information should be verified on a separate
communication channel from the signed object itself to ensure the
integrity and validity of the public key.

signature:: the actual digital signature value represented as
a `CharacterString`, encoded in Base64 format.


=== Localization

The language and script used within this interchange address profile.

Represented by the `PT_Locale` object defined in <<ISO19115-1>> and an ISO
15924 script code.

locale:: the locale of the parent object,
represented by `PT_Locale` with `characterEncoding` set to `UTF-8`.

script:: the type of written script used in the parent object,
represented by the script code from <<ISO15924>>.

Does it use PT_Locale ?
****

[source=Ronald Tse]
****
We didn't intend to use PT_Locale but perhaps it could work better here:

a) PT_Locale refers to ISO 3166-1, which contains three sets of codes:
alpha-2, alpha-3 and numeric. For clarity purposes in implementation,
could we lock it down to one set of these codes?
****

[source=Stephane Garcia]
****
Yes it would be a valid extension of ISO 19115
****

****
b) MD_CharacterSetCode refers to an IANA character set registry which describes the "encoding" but not the "script" used. For example, Chinese can be represented in Traditional or Simplified script -- in the IANA character registry, the encoding for both are usually Unicode and represented as UTF-8. Perhaps we could represent the ISO 15924 "script code" in an adjacent attribute?
****

[source=Stephane Garcia]
****
I don't think adding an attribute to PT_Locale would be a valid extension of ISO 19115.

I suggest leaving localization (or locale) with an attribute of type PT_Locale for the language / country code / encoding + leaving the attribute script.
And also we should ask for a change in ISO 19115-1 to add “script” into PT_Locale if we think it is needed.
****

Localization information includes:

* locale: <<ISO19115-1>> `PT_Locale`
* script: <<ISO15924>> Script Identifier Code

=== Validity

version: Is it taken from MD_Identifier ?
****

[source=Ronald Tse]
****
version:
It was meant to be a simplistic “version” that allows differentiation of different instances of the published data. Would usage of MD_Identifier here be an overkill, since it includes many other attributes like authority, code, codeSpace, and description? Or we could find a way to align with it?
****

The time interval where this interchange address profile
is determined valid, and the revision number (represented as a date).

Each of such is represented as a `CI_Date` object defined in <<ISO19115-1>>.

validityBegins:: the date and time when this object becomes valid.
The type of `CI_Date` should be `validityBegins`.

validityEnds:: the date and time when this object becomes invalid.
The type of `CI_Date` should be `validityEnds`.

revision:: issuance date/time of this object.
The type of `CI_Date` should be `revision`.
