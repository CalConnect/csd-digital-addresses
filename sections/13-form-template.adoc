=== General

.Interchange form template data model
image::images/png/Model!FormTemplate_4.png[]

This section shows how an input form can be rendered according to
the interchange address class.

The form template should use should also provide an example for display
purposes in input (e.g., Help section).

The form template is used for displaying an
input form for entry of address data into an
interchange address instance.
Generally, one address class is represented
by just one input template.

NOTE: this part has no equivalence in PADTL.

[[form-line]]
=== Form line

A form line represents a line within a form layout.

It extends from the `LineElementReference` model, and
takes a set of elements that contain
form line element references (`FormLineElementReference`).

[[form-line-element-ref]]
=== Form line element reference

[[form-line-element]]
=== Form line element

This represents an element within a form line.

The three types of form line elements include:

* static text element, representing static text, such as the
phrase "PO Box" preceding the actual PO box number,
for form layouts for PO boxes. This element is meant
to be shown in the form but not allow modification.

* data element, representing a variable data value
that is contained in the interchange address component, such
as the PO box number following the phrase "PO Box".
This element indicates that a form field is required,
and the data values accepted shall adhere to the
data value type defined in its associated interchange address component
(through `FormLine`).

* selection element, representing a selectable mapping between
display string to code, e.g. in the case of the US States, "Rhode Island"
the state name is mapped to the "RI" postal code. Represented
by `SelectionElement` and within `SelectionPair`.

In an empty form with fields generated from data elements,
if the `example` values of the associated
interchange address component are specified,
such values should be used as "`placeholders`"
for form input.


=== User experience considerations

It should be assumed that users may not often be able to enter
an address thoroughly in the correct, detailed structure.

Therefore, the form should be easy to understand and take
into account that easy switching between interchange address classes
is important.

An application that adheres to this document may find that it is
easiest for the user to first select the appropriate addressClass, then
allowing users to (or automatically) add necessary components as they
type.

A sample input should be provided for demonstration purposes.
