== Interchange address profile

=== General

The interchange address profile corresponds to a representation of
the _address profile_ in <<ISO19160-1>> suitable for digital
distribution.

This model includes the necessary information for a machine-readable
implementation to understand how to represent addresses, their requirements,
as well as their input and display.

=== Publisher

I donâ€™t know, I just wanted to point out that there are some metadata elements in this document and if possible, they should be aligned with ISO 19115-1. Having had a second look at it, I would also suggest that the publisher information should be of type CI_Party.

MD_Identifier is an overkill for just storing version information. Updated publisher to be of type "CI_PARTY".

Details about the publisher of this interchange address profile,
including the name of publisher and an accessible URI that can be used
to update this interchange address profile itself.

Represented by the `CI_Party` object defined in <<ISO19115-1>>, the URI
should be represented as a `CI_OnlineResource` object specified within
`CI_Party.contactInfo.onlineResource`.

=== Identifier

Used to identify this interchange address profile and provide
description of it.

Represented by the `MD_Identifier` object defined in <<ISO19115-1>>.

=== Area applicability

spatialRefSys: I think geometry already has a spatialRefSys embedded.

Here maybe you would like to reference the metadata element
MD_ReferenceSystem from 19115-1 rather than ISO 19107

The entire spatialPosition is replaced with MD_SpatialReference
****

The geographic representation of which this interchange address profile
applies to. Overlapping geographic areas are allowed across different
interchange address profiles.

Represented by one or more `MD_SpatialRepresentation` objects
defined in <<ISO19115-1>>.

[example]
Countries that have overlapping geographic claims are allowed to represent
their purported claims in interchange address profiles.
