== Data types

=== Primitive and core data types

These are the common data types used within this document.

Primitive data types (`PrimitiveTypes`) are defined in <<ISO19103,clause 7.2>>,
including:

* `CharacterString`
* `DateTime`, `Date`, `Time`
* `Number`, `Integer`, `Decimal`, `Real`
* `Vector`
* `Boolean`

Core data types (`CoreTypes`) are defined in <<ISO19103,clause A.2>>.

=== User-defined data types

****
Does MD_DatatypeCode help ?
****

User defined data types are defined within the profile that utilizes
them. A user defined data type can be composed of multiple primitive
data types, and constraints can be set on them.

coreType:: AddressComponentDataType

constraints:: DataTypeConstraints

==== Data Type Constraints

[source=Stephane Garcia]
****
Constraints: Will there be a constraint codelist or is this free text.
And if so, why not use OCL?
****

Constraints that can be set depend on the underlying data type. For
example, the maximum number of Post Office Box numbers.

* Number types: "maxValue" and "minValue".
* Number and characters: "maxLength" and "minLength".

As a constraint, it is also possible to provide a fixed list of
accepted values to this type, such as the number of states in a country
or districts in a city.
