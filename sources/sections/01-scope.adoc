== Scope

This document specifies a set of data models suitable for machine encoding of address information, called the
"`Address Interchange Object`" ("`AXO`") models, and the use of them.

Specifically, this document provides:

* data models for digital storage and interchange of address profiles
  conforming to <<ISO19160-1>>;

* data models for digital storage and interchange of addresses
  conforming to a specific address profile;

* data models for entry and display templates for entering and
  displaying addresses conforming to the profile and encoding rules above; and

* the management and operations of a register of address profiles
  conforming to this document.

Addressability, and features provided within the object which the address
points to, is not described in this document. Specifically, the
`AddressableObject` from <<ISO19160-1>> is considered out of scope.
