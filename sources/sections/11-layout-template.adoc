== Interchange layout template

=== General

.Interchange layout template data model

The interchange layout template serves as the basis of the
interchange display template and
the interchange form template.

A layout template is designed to present an
interchange address instance in the case of a display template, or
present an input form for entry of an interchange address instance
in the case of an interchange form template.

The interchange layout template is based on the following assumptions:

* the resulting layout is displayed in a bounded rectangular area

* the entire template is in the same script and locale.

The action of inserting components from a given interchange
address instance into a layout template is called "render".

// TODO: define "render" in terms and definition

[example]
A postal mail label can be considered an interchange address instance
rendered according to a layout template.


=== Attributes

|===
|Attribute    |Type              |Description
|ID           |`CharacterString` |Unique identifier for the layout template.
|Name         |`CharacterString` |Descriptive name of the layout template.
|Description  |`CharacterString` |Textual description of the layout template.
|Localization |`Localization`         |Locale and script information of the layout template.
|Dimensions   |`LayoutDimension` |Physical dimensions of the rectangular
bounding box for the rendered layout output.
|Orientation  |`CharacterString` |Horizontal or vertical of the text orientation.
|===

[example]
Some East Asian languages allow using a vertical flow text orientation
on postal mail.


This structure of a bounding box allows flexible formatting,
such as the ability to hide or shrink certain lines when
horizontal space is limited.


=== Layout line

==== General

A layout line represents a line in a rendered address display
or an address input form.

It forms the basis of the address display line and
address form line.


==== Attributes

|Attribute    |Type              |Description
|Dimensions   |`LayoutDimension` |Physical dimensions of the rectangular bounding box
for the rendered Line.
|Elements         |`CharacterString` |Collection of line elements that make up the line.

=== Line element reference

==== General

.Interchange line element reference data model
image::LineElementReference.png[]

A line element reference is used to link an abstract line element to
the interchange address component. The latter is used to
retrieve metadata for the line element,
such as the schema to determine what data values are accepted.

It is the basis of the display line element reference and the
form line element reference.

==== Attributes

|===
|Attribute   |Type              |Description
|Target      |`CharacterString` |The interchange address component this
reference refers to.
|Name        |`CharacterString` |Human readable name of what this line element
reference refers to.
|Description |`CharacterString` |Human readable description of what this line
element reference refers to.
