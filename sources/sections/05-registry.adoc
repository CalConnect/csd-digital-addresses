== Address profile registry

=== General

The ISO address profile registry will be managed with version control software,
publicly available with an API and a graphical user interface, such as a web-based interface,
to satisfy both programatic and human use for the dissemination, display and management
of the registry.

The ISO address profile register is a non-hierarchical register. References to principal registers and sub-registers are excluded from this document.

This address profile registry follows the requirements specified in
<<ISO19135-1>>, and additional requirements specified in this standard.

Rules for managing a register of geographical information items, including the submission of information, are found in <<ISO19135-1,clause=6>>.

NOTE: Reference to a corresponding <<ISO19135-1>> requirement is explicitly
denoted.


=== Roles and responsibilities in the management of an address profile registry

The roles and responsibilities of the register owner, register manager, submitting organizations,
control body, registry manager and register user are set out in <<ISO19135-1>>.

Requirement 1 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="1">>): The register owner shall set terms and conditions regarding different levels of access to the register and making the contents available to the public. In addition, the register owner shall specify the time period in which the approval process shall be completed.

Requirement 2 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="2">>): The register owner shall appoint a register manager. A register owner may serve as the register manager for any register that it has established or it may appoint another organization to serve as the register manager.

Requirement 3 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="3">>): The register owner shall decide whether a control body is required for the register and if so appoint the control body. The register owner may serve as the control body for any register that it has established or it may delegate that role to a subgroup within the organization or to the register manager.

Requirement 4 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="4">>): A register owner shall specify the criteria that determine which organizations may act as submitting organizations.

Requirement 5 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="5">>): The register owner shall clarify the process for a submitting organization to appeal decisions of the control body (if such a body is appointed). The register owner may establish a procedure for such a process. The specification of this procedure shall include appropriate time limits for completion of the process. An alternative solution may be for a submitting organization to resubmit a new proposal with changes or a better justification.

Requirement 6 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="6">>): A register manager shall manage a register in conformance with <<ISO19135-1,clause=6>>.

Requirement 7 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="7">>): Upon request, the register manager shall distribute an information package containing a description of the register and how to submit proposals for changes to the content of the register. The information package shall describe what proposed changes to the content may be considered to be substantive.

Requirement 8 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="8">>): The register manager shall accept proposals from submitting organizations and manage the proposals as specified in <<ISO19135-1,clause=6.4>>. The register manager shall pass proposals to the control body for decisions as to acceptability and shall serve as the point of contact between the control body and the submitting organization for negotiations regarding changes to the proposal.

Requirement 9 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="9">>): The register manager shall determine whether a submitting organization is
qualified in accordance with the criteria established by the register owner.

Requirement 10 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="10">>): If a control body is appointed, it shall accept proposals from the register manager and render a decision regarding each proposal within the time limits specified by the register owner.

Requirement 11 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="11">>): A registry manager shall ensure the integrity of any register held in the registry and shall provide means for electronic access to the registry for register managers, control body members, and register users.

Requirement 12 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="12">>): Register managers shall consider the requirements of different categories of users in selecting methods for publishing the content of a register.

Requirement 13: The ISO address profile register shall have a publicly available record of changes where historical content shall remain publicly available.

Submitting organizations for the ISO address profile register consist of organizations and/or persons responsible for defining and maintaining address profiles.


=== Unmodified ISO 19135-1:2015 requirements

The unmodified <<ISO19135-1>> requirements are as follows:

Requirement 14 (<<ISO19135-1,locality:requirement="13">>): Every register shall have a technical document describing the item classes to be registered.
