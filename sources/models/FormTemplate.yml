  FormTemplate:
    definition: |
      This section shows how an input form can be rendered according to
      the interchange address class.

      The form template should use should also provide an example for display
      purposes in input (e.g., Help section).

      The form template is used for displaying an
      input form for entry of address data into an
      interchange address instance.
      Generally, one address class is represented
      by just one input template.

      NOTE: this part has no equivalence in PATDL.

  FormLine:
    definition: |
      A form line represents a line within a form layout.

      It extends from the `LineElementReference` model, and
      takes a set of elements that contain
      form line element references (`FormLineElementReference`).

  FormLineElement:
    definition: |
      This represents an element within a form line.

      In an empty form with fields generated from data elements,
      if the `example` values of the associated
      interchange address component are specified,
      such values should be used as "`placeholders`"
      for form input.
