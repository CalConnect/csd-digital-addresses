  InterchangeAddressClass:
    definition: |
      Interchange address class corresponds to the `addressClass` specified in
      <<ISO19160-1>>.

      A single profile can include and support multiple types of
      address formats, such as a numbered street address and a
      "PO Box" address simultaneously. Each of these address formats
      is represented as an interchange address class.

      [example]
      The US Numbered Thoroughfare Address with this syntax can be
      represented as an interchange address class:
      * { Complete Landmark Name or Complete Place Name }
      * { Complete Address Number * }
      * { Complete Street Name * }
      * { Complete Subaddress }
      * { Complete Place Name * }
      * { State Name * }
      * { Zip Code }
      * { Zip Plus 4 }
      * { Country Name }

      An interchange address class also provides a display template
      and a form template to allow the display and entry of an
      address instance of the address class.
