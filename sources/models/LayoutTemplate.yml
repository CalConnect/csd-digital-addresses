    definition: |
      The interchange layout template serves as the basis of the
      interchange display template and
      the interchange form template.

      A layout template is designed to present an
      interchange address instance in the case of a display template, or
      present an input form for entry of an interchange address instance
      in the case of an interchange form template.

      The interchange layout template is based on the following assumptions:

      * the resulting layout is displayed in a bounded rectangular area

      * the entire template is in the same script and locale.

      The action of inserting components from a given interchange
      address instance into a layout template is called "render".

      // TODO: define "render" in terms and definition

      [example]
      A postal mail label can be considered an interchange address instance
      rendered according to a layout template.
