      A cryptographic signature used to determine data integrity and validity of the object it belongs to.
    attributes:
      algorithm:
        definition: The public key cryptographic algorithm used for this digital signature.
        type: Oid
        origin: ISO14888
      publicKey:
        definition: A reference to the actual public key used to verify the digital signature, a URI where the public key of the signer used for this signature is found.
        type: Uri
      signature:
        definition: The actual digital signature value encoded in Base64 format.

enums:
  TextDirectionCode:
    definition: |
      An enumeration value of TextDirectionCode represents the reading
      direction of textual data whether it is from left to right or right to
      left, and from top to bottom or bottom to top.
    type: enumeration
    values:
      leftToRightTopToBottom:
        definition: Indicating that text should be read left to right, and top to bottom.
      rightToLeftTopToBottom:
        definition: Indicating that text should be read right to left, and top to bottom.
      leftToRightBottomToTop:
        definition: Indicating that text should be read left to right, and bottom to top.
