name: SpecificationLevel
modelType: class
definition: |
  When an address is first manually entered by a common person, it is
  unrealistic to expect this person to fully adhere to the defined
  structure.

  The allowed values of specification levels are:

  * Fully structured, all components are accurately separated and cannot
  be further split.

  * Partially structured, some components may be structurally
  correct, but some other components are still unstructured.

  * Unstructured, the user has entered free-form text with no regard of
  structuring them.

  [example]
  Digital addresses entered on e-commerce sites and address books
  are often partially structured, with defined country, region
  and city, but with street addresses often unstructured.

  [example]
  Digital addresses for utility installations
  (e.g. electricity, water supplies) are often fully structured.

  Therefore, an organization who accepts these addresses may wish to
  re-structure them or fill in any missing address components.
