modelType: class
definition: |
  Interchange address class corresponds to the `addressClass` specified in
  <<ISO19160-1>>.

  A single profile can include and support multiple types of
  address formats, such as a numbered street address and a
  "PO Box" address simultaneously. Each of these address formats
  is represented as an interchange address class.

  [example]
  The US Numbered Thoroughfare Address with this syntax can be
  represented as an interchange address class:

  *{sp}{ Complete Landmark Name or Complete Place Name } +
  *{sp}{ Complete Address Number * } +
  *{sp}{ Complete Street Name * } +
  *{sp}{ Complete Subaddress } +
  *{sp}{ Complete Place Name * } +
  *{sp}{ State Name * } +
  *{sp}{ Zip Code } +
  *{sp}{ Zip Plus 4 } +
  *{sp}{ Country Name }

  An interchange address class also provides a display template
  and a form template to allow the display and entry of an
  address instance of the address class.
